# Agile Content - Frontend - Lucas Alves Barbosa

## What would you have done differently if you had more time? Why?

I'd probably have implemented more tests;

I'd have implemented skeleton loading for the card;

I'd have implemented animations for the card showing up and a very subtle animation if you hovered your mouse over it;

I'd have implemented an auto-complete, so when the user typed ''ca'' they'd suggest cat, ''d'', they'd suggest dog, etc.

## What do I need to run this?

Node (most recent LTS version)

## Instructions


### 1 - clone the repo
### 2 - npm install
### 3 - npm run test (to run the tests)
### 4 - npm run dev (to run the application)
### 5 - open the application. Normally it's on http://localhost:5173/
